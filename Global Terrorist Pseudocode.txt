START
OPEN AND READ THE FILE 'TERRORIST.TEXT' LINE BY LINE AND SAVE IT TO A VARIABLE "ALL_TERRORIST"
SAVE THE FIRST LINE OF THE TEXT FILE TO A VARIABLE TOTAL_TERROR AS IT MARKS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES
CREATE A MULTIDIMENTIONAL ARRAY "TERRORIST" TO HOLD THE ARRAY OF EACH TERRORIST CASES
CREATE A VARIABLE "TERROR_SUM" TO HOLD THE SUM OF EACH TERRORIST CASES
CREATE A VARIABLE "SIMILARITY_ID" TO HOLD THE ID OF THE TERRORIST CASE THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE CURRRENT TERRORIST CASE

LOOP THROUGH "ALL_TERRORIST" AND SPLIT EACH ELEMENT WITH ','
THEN CONVERT EACH COMMA SEPRATED ELEMENT TO AN INTEGER AND SAVE THEM TO A TEMPORARY ARRAY "TEMP"
APPEND "TEMP" ARRAY TO MULTIDIMENTIONAL ARRAY "TERRORIST"
ALSO FIND THE SUM OF ELEMENTS IN "TEMP" ARRAY AND APPEND IT TO "TERROR_SUM" ARRAY

LOOP THROUGH EACH ELEMENT IN "TERROR_SUM" AND COMPARE WITH OTHER ELEMENTS IN "TERROR_SUM",
IF THE CURRENT ELEMENT FIND ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT HAS THE SAME VALUE, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT
THEY HAVE THE SAME TERRORIST, TO CONFIRM THAT, COMPARE THEIR TERRORIST CELL TO CELL. IF THEY HAVE THE SAME TERRORIST,
SET THE "SIMILARITY_ID" FOR THE CURRENT ELEMENT TO THE INDEX OF THE LOOKALIKE ELEMENT.

AFTER ALL PROCESS, SIMILARITY_ID WILL HAVE STORED THE ID OF TERRORIST CASE THAT IS SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER.
DISPLAY THE "SIMILARITY_ID" ARRAY.
STOP
